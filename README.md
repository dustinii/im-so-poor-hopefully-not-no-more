AnalyzedJobPosting JSON Schema README
Overview
This document describes the JSON schema for an AnalyzedJobPosting. This schema defines the expected structure and data types for JSON objects that represent job postings after they have been processed and analyzed, likely by a Large Language Model (LLM) or similar AI system.

The primary purpose of this schema is to ensure consistency and validity of job posting data as it's stored, processed, or exchanged between different components of an application. It facilitates:

Data Validation: Ensuring that any new job posting data conforms to the expected format before being accepted or processed.

Data Integrity: Maintaining a standardized structure for all analyzed job postings.

Developer Understanding: Providing a clear blueprint for developers working with this data.

Automated Tooling: Enabling the use of tools that can leverage schemas for tasks like code generation, documentation, or automated testing.

Schema Structure
The schema is defined according to the JSON Schema Draft 07 specification.

Root Level Properties
The main properties at the root of an AnalyzedJobPosting object are:

_id (string, required): A unique identifier for the document. Typically, this would be a MongoDB ObjectId string or a similar unique ID.

userId (string, optional): An identifier for the user who requested or is associated with the analysis of this job posting.

sourceUrl (string, URI format, optional): The original URL where the job posting was found.

jobPostingText (string, required): The full raw text content of the job posting.

dateAdded (string, date-time format, required): The ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the job posting was added to the system.

analysisDate (string, date-time format, required): The ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed on the job posting.

llmAnalyzerVersion (string, optional): The version of the LLM or analysis tool used to process the job posting.

analyzedContent (object, required): An object containing all the structured information extracted and inferred from the job posting by the analysis process.

analyzedContent Object Properties
This nested object contains the core output of the job posting analysis. Key fields include:

job_title_detected (string, required): The job title as identified by the analyzer.

company_name_detected (string, required): The company name as identified.

location_detected (string, optional): The location of the job.

salary_range_detected (string, optional): Any salary information found.

employment_type (string, optional): Type of employment (e.g., "Full-time", "Contract").

required_skills (array of objects, required): A list of skills deemed essential for the role. Each skill object contains:

skill (string, required): The name of the skill.

priority (string, required, enum: "high", "medium", "low"): The perceived importance of the skill.

years_experience_min (number or null, optional): Minimum years of experience for the skill, if specified.

preferred_skills (array of objects, optional): A list of skills that are desired but not strictly mandatory, with the same structure as required_skills.

experience_level_required (string, optional): The overall experience level sought (e.g., "Senior", "5+ years").

education_requirements (string, optional): Educational qualifications mentioned.

responsibilities_summary (array of strings, required): A list of key responsibilities.

cultural_cues (array of strings, optional): Phrases or terms indicating company culture.

implicit_needs (array of strings, optional): Skills or attributes implied but not explicitly stated.

key_performance_indicators_inferred (array of strings, optional): Potential KPIs for the role.

benefits_mentioned (array of strings, optional): Any benefits listed in the posting.

application_instructions (string, optional): How to apply for the job.

vector_embedding_job_description (array of numbers, optional): A numerical vector representation (embedding) of the job description, useful for semantic search or similarity comparisons.

Usage
To use this schema:

Save the schema: Store the JSON schema definition in a .json file.

Choose a validator: Select a JSON schema validator library appropriate for your programming language or environment (e.g., Ajv for JavaScript/Node.js, jsonschema for Python).

Validate data: In your application, load the schema and use the validator to check if incoming or outgoing AnalyzedJobPosting JSON objects conform to the defined structure.
